# High Fidelity Prototype Review
---

We used affordances to make it easy to book a hamper. The UI to book a hamper is designed to look like a [calendar](ReviewImages/Calendar.png) which most people are familiar with. In addition, we highlighted the days which they are unable to book. This allows them to plan their bookings easier.

In addition we used symbols to indicate the [status](ReviewImages/Confirm.png) of a booking. This will assure their booking has been approved and confirmed, and also lets the users know at a glance whether something is wrong.

In the [support](ReviewImages/Faq.png) page we grouped similar questions together to make it easier for a user to find what they are looking for. This gestalt makes it easier to find out more about a topic because the questions are in a logical arrangement. In addition each topic is associated with a step in the user flow, and they are ordered chronologically.

In our [support](ReviewImages/Question.png) page, we included a signifier by having a grayed default text in the input box stating “Please type your question here“ to indicate where the user needs to ask their question. This is then followed by a checkbox to indicate what method the user would like to communicate with and a button labeled “Submit”.
