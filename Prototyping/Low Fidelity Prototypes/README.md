# Low Fidelity Prototype Review

In consideration of our designs, discoverability was a focus. We want to encourage the use of a service by decreasing the factors that could lead to folks becoming overwhelmed with the user interface. For example, in our designs we have combined 3 different concepts with a focus on discoverability; mapping; signifiers; and feedback.

Displaying a full month's calendar, by enclosing the two-week allowable booking time frame in a shaded area we are using gestalt principles to provide the user with information. The calendar is a signifier of the available days which are available for booking, rather than being presented in a tabular form, providing the user with a familiar and comfortable interface.

In our designs, signifiers are often used to give the user an indication of what to input in each field, so the foodbank has the required data from them. This is apparent in our idea of how to modify household members with signifiers over the name, date of birth, and gender fields to not only indicate they are required, but also what to put in them.

In our prototypes, we tried to keep the user updated on what they do. For instance, when the user clicks the Confirm button at the end of placing an order page, they will be directed to a confirmation page where they will be able to see their order details and some instructions for delivery/pickup. If we were to give no information when the user clicks the Confirm button, then users will be confused, wondering if the order was placed or not, should they reorder? Leaving users confused is not what human centered design is aiming for.

Further more, as *feedback* from the system is available, the *closure* is extended providing further *continuity* in the process and by presenting back the information that the user entered in a different layout, we are making the *connection* between what the user has entered and what the system has understood and confirmed, providing comfort to the user that their request will be fulfilled.
