The ongoing effects of the pandemic have created an increased need for support in our community, this is coupled with inflation that is particularly acute in its impact on non-discretionary items, food, rent, etc. have created demand growth that is leveling up. While the food bank has the logistic capacity to meet the need on the supply end the surge in demand has in many cases overwhelmed the organizationâ€™s capacity to book orders.

In the first pahse of the project, when we were first introduced to the probelm and opportunity we decided that the episodic customers, who may be new to seeking assistance from a service such as the Food Bank, would be the northstar customer for this project. As these folks may not be familiar with the process, it is important to reduce the severity of the barriers (onboarding) to them as much as possible. And the carryover customer would include chronic customers who require more regular assistance. As these customers are already familiar with the physical process of booking.
