# About the Regina Food Bank
*by John Bailey*

### Overview
The Regina Food Bank is the oldest food bank in Canada. The user base of the organization comes from all over the city and ranges from those who request services only once or twice to those who require services on an ongoing basis. The current system for an individual or family to request service is to phone in to a centralized call centre and have a team member set up an appointment in our booking software.

### The challenge

This is a twofold issue. The ongoing effects of the pandemic have created an increased need for support in our community, this is coupled with inflation that is particularly acute in its impact on non-discretionary items, food, rent, etc. have created demand growth that is not levelling off.  While the food bank has the logistic capacity to meet the need on the supply end the surge in demand has in many cases overwhelmed the organizationâ€™s capacity to book orders.  High wait times and increasing call drops are presenting an increasing barrier to service.

### The opportunity
The Regina Food Bank uses a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool for food provisioning built by a company called Link2Feed (L2F).  L2F has signed an exclusive engagement with Food Banks Canada to manage CRM activities. At the beginning of the pandemic, L2F rushed a product to launch that allowed for online scheduling, where the Regina Food Bank was part of the pilot group. Ultimately the project failed because its application was better suited to real-time sign up (i.e. when clients were already inline) and was not a viable solution for advanced booking.

The system provisioned by L2F can import and export data and can integrate through an application programming interface (API). The opportunity here is to design, prototype, and (likely later) explore the development of a solution that allows clients to book hamper pick-ups 24/7. Thus, eliminating barriers to access and potentially freeing up time to grow the overall impact of the Food Bank on the lives of people facing food insecurity.
