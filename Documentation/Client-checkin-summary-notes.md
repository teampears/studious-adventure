  - Reduce the barriers that people with food insecurity face.
#### Important Experiences:
   - Confirmation that the order was received
    - it reduces phone calls and increases people's comfort

### Checkpoint 2.1
01.03.22
#### Feedback given for lofis
  - We should make the delivery time in ranges rather than exact times
  - General flow is good and makes sense
  - Good to know the data of each household member (name, age, gender etc..)
  - The houshold data is important for analytical analysis (determine the source of duplicates in the system)
#### Other notes from other groups
  - Needed but non-mandatory data will be sent to us by Tim
  - Family and profile information should only need to be entered once
  - Names and age is important for household memebers
  - Households can be multiple families
  - Household data is important for movement tracking (e.g. shared custody of a child)
#### Answers to questions
  - Income amount is not really need (cannot be verified)
  - Income source is far more important than income ammount
  - Household names and age is important to track movement as well as get a good picture for hamper composition
