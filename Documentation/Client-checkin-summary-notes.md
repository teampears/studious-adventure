### Checkpoint 1.2
09.02.22
#### Key Components to the design:
  - easy/ user friendly booking
  - ongoing access
  - Confirmation
  - Reduce the barriers that people with food insecurity face.
#### Important Experiences:
   - Confirmation that the order was received
    - it reduces phone calls and increases people's comfort
#### Agencies' booking process:
  - Similar to the process chronic and episodic users go through, just they book a bulk/ batch
  - "Just a batch registration"

### Observational Confirmations
* #### What is the main problem?
	* booking is not easy or transparent to users
* #### What "experiences" (features and functionality) are most important
	* ongoing access
	* being able to view availability, options, times, confirmation that the booking will happen at that time and place
* #### What are the specific features that are important now (for MVP 1) vs what could potentially wait for a future version?
	* ### easy booking
	* ## confirmation of delivery
		* wait on: availability and food options
* #### Who is the main beneficiary (and who are the ones that may also benefit from your design ideas)?
	* episodic users - northstar customers
		* people who are entering food insecurity
	* chronic users - carryover customers
* #### And any Q/A
	* what does the organizational workflow look like
	* how far in advance should booking be allowed

### Checkpoint 2.1
01.03.22
#### Feedback given for lofis
  - We should make the delivery time in ranges rather than exact times
  - General flow is good and makes sense
  - Good to know the data of each household member (name, age, gender etc..)
  - The houshold data is important for analysis (determine the source of duplicates in the system)
#### Other notes from other groups
  - Needed but non-mandatory data will be sent to us by Tim
  - Family and profile information should only need to be entered once
  - Names and age is important for household memebers
  - Households can be multiple families
  - Household data is important for movement tracking (e.g. shared custody of a child)
#### Answers to questions
  - Income amount is not really need (cannot be verified)
  - Income source is far more important than income ammount
  - Household names and age is important to track movement as well as get a good picture for hamper composition

### Checkpoint 3.1
16.03.22
#### Misc additional new information
- Canada food guide for categories of food included in the basket
  - potential to add an education piece on this
- expectation management
  - what the user would see as available vs what was delivered
#### Hifi Feedback
- landing page - simplify flow
- age missing for household members
- good flow for household vs individual
- check vs x details
  - showing booking status for waiting
  - showing booking status for confirmed
  - explain the delivery
- add integration for confirmation for sms or email
#### Future integrations
- 5-10% no shows, visually showing it on profiles allows for potential escalation for repeated no shows
    - analytics on FAQ/Support
    - tie to CRM for line of sight on potential repeat / high volume questions or issues

### Checkpoint 4.1
6.04.22
#### Demo feedback
- The overall look of the website looks good.
- good use of responsive design, mobile version vs desktop version
- add an explanation to the user when asking about the number of household members
	- make sure that the user know that the number of household members doesn't include the one who started the registration.
	- the one started the registartion is already registered
- give users a time spot for answering questions
	- for example, "We will get back to you in X amount of hours"
	- Good to give people the opportunity to ask questions
