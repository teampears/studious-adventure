## Business Need
Food insecurity alone is a daunting issue to tackle, while the Food Bank provides support to those in need additional barriers only hinder an individuals capacity to change their situation. As John put it, the goal of the Food Bank is to solve food insecurity, not to provide security and part of that solution is reducing the number and size of the barriers that folks suffering from food insecurity face.

One of the largest barriers is the ability of folks to book a hamper, and to know with confidence that it will be there when they arrive, without spending precious time on the phone waiting for help.Â By providing an easy means of booking, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and providing a means of confirmation the barrier to support is reduced.

## Challenge
The main issue that the food bank is facing is booking is not easy for customers. There is a large need for customers to be able to book a hamper anywhere and anytime with assurance that they will be able to get their hamper. Since it is difficult to book a hamper currently, there is a large drop off rate in their support lines since they are overwhelmed with calls causing long wait times wasting valuable minutes.

## Customers

### Northstar
The primary northstar customer is episodic users who are new to having food insecurities. This is because the amount of customers the foodbank has had to serve has increased significantly due to the pandemic, and inflation. These customers are not familiar with the platform and have been flooding the support calls which lead to a high drop off rate.

### Carryover
These include chronic customers who are already likely onboarded and are very familiar with the proccess of booking. They will appreciate the extra ease to book hampers, but since they are already onboarded they do not require it. It also includes agencies such as Salvation Army who need bulk booking. Currently they book hampers about the same way clients book them, so they will also benifit from this streamlining.

## Assumptions

* Routific handles deliveries and routing
* Food is delivered in 5 days or less
* 70% of customer food needs are served
* Income, household size, and dietary needs are gathered from customers
