In consideration of our designs, discoverability was a focus. We want to encourage the use of a service by decreasing the factors that could lead to folks becoming overwhelmed with the user interface. For example, on the booking page we have combined 3 different concepts with a focus on discoverability; *mapping; signifiers; and feedback*. 

Displaying a full month's calendar, by *enclosing* the two-week allowable booking timeframe in a shaded area we are using gestalt principles to provide the user with information. The calendar is a *signifier* of the available days which are available for booking, rather than being presented in a tabular form, providing the user with a familiar and comfortable interface.

Further more, as *feedback* from the system is available, the *closure* is extended providing further *continuity* in the process and by presenting back the information that the user entered in a different layout, we are making the *connection* between what the user has entered and what the system has understood and confirmed, providing comfort to the user that their request will be fulfilled.
