# studious-adventure
Over the lifecycle of the project, various aspects of the design process have been explored through various acitvities.

## Activity 1
Activity 1 encompassed the *observe & frame* stage consisting of meeting with the stakeholders and exploring the problem through [mapping activities](Mapping%20Activities/) such as empathy mapping, customer jounery mapping, and userstory mapping.

## Activity 2
Activity 2 consisted of *brainstorming and divergence* where multiple [low-fidelity prototypes](Low%20Fidelity%20Prototypes/) were created to get a sense of the customer's needs and think openly about the problem.

## Activity 3
Activity 3 consisted of *brainstorming and convergence* where one [high-fidelity prototype](High%20Fidelity%20Prototype/) was created to converge on the ideas explored through the low-fidelity prototypes and feedback received from the customer. Mobile and desktop implementations were considered.

## Activity 4
Activity four focuses on building the minimal viable product and delivering it to the customer for deployment.

# Documentation

A [project charter](Documentation/ProjectCharter.md) was created defining the problem statement and presenting information given by the client.

[Periodic checkins](Documentation/Client-checkin-summary-notes.md) allowed for the team to iteratively build upon the feedback provided by the client to best develop a solution to fit their needs.

Reviews for each prototyping phase provide the details of the design concepts learned throughout the course of the project implemented in each of the [low-fidelity](Prototyping/Low%20Fidelity%20Prototypes/Lofi-prototype-review.md) and [high-fidelity](Prototyping/High%20Fidelity%20Prototype/Hifi-prototype-review.md) prototypes.
