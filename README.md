## Business Need
Food insecurity alone is a daunting issue to tackle, while the Food Bank provides support to those in need additional barriers only hinder an individuals capacity to change their situation. As John put it, the goal of the Food Bank is to solve food insecurity, not to provide security and part of that solution is reducing the number and size of the barriers that folks suffering from food insecurity face.

One of the largest barriers is the ability of folks to book a hamper, and to know with confidence that it will be there when they arrive, without spending precious time on the phone waiting for help. By providing an easy means of booking, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and providing a means of confirmation the barrier to support is reduced.
## Challenge
The main issue that the food bank is facing is booking is not easy for customers. There is a large need for customers to be able to book a hamper anywhere and anytime which assurance that they will be able to get their hamper delivered. Since it is difficult to book a hamper currently, there is a large drop off in their support lines since they are overwhelmed with calls causing long wait times wasting valuable minutes. 

## Customers

### Northstar
The primary northstar customer is episodic users who are new to having food insecurities. This is because the amount of customers the foodbank has had to serve has increased significantly due to the pandemic, and inflation. These customers are not familiar with the platform and have been flooding the support calls which lead to a high drop off rate.
### Carryover
These include chronic customers who are already likely onboarded and are very familiar with the proccess of booking. They will appreciate the extra ease to book hampers, but since they are already onboarded they do not require it. It also includes agencies such as Salvation Army who need bulk booking. Currently they book hampers about the same way clients book them, so they will also benifit from this streamlining 
## Assumptions
* Will be developed in WordPress
* Full working product will not be delevered, only ideas and designs

## Constraints
* L2F must be the main CRM
* Routific handles deliveries and routing
* Food is delivered in 5 days or less
* 70% of customer food needs are served
* Income, household size, and dietary needs are gathered from customers

## About the Regina Food Bank
*by John Bailey*

### Overview
The Regina Food Bank is the oldest food bank in Canada. The user base of the organization comes from all over the city and ranges from those who request services only once or twice to those who require services on an ongoing basis. The current system for an individual or family to request service is to phone in to a centralized call center and have a team member set up an appointment in our booking software.

### The challenge

This is a twofold issue. The ongoing effects of the pandemic have created an increased need for support in our community, this is coupled with inflation that is particularly acute in its impact on non-discretionary items, food, rent, etc. have created demand growth that is not levelling off.  While the food bank has the logistic capacity to meet the need on the supply end the surge in demand has in many cases overwhelmed the organization’s capacity to book orders.  High wait times and increasing call drops are presenting an increasing barrier to service.

### The opportunity
The Regina Food Bank uses a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool for food provisioning built by a company called Link2Feed (L2F).  L2F has signed an exclusive engagement with Food Banks Canada to manage CRM activities. At the beginning of the pandemic, L2F rushed a product to launch that allowed for online scheduling, where the Regina Food Bank was part of the pilot group. Ultimately the project failed because its application was better suited to real-time sign up (i.e. when clients were already inline) and was not a viable solution for advanced booking.

The system provisioned by L2F can import and export data and can integrate through an application programming interface (API). The opportunity here is to design, prototype, and (likely later) explore the development of a solution that allows clients to book hamper pick-ups 24/7. Thus, eliminating barriers to access and potentially freeing up time to grow the overall impact of the Food Bank on the lives of people facing food insecurity.
